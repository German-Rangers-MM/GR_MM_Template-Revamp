This Mission was build with the UAMT (Ultimate Arma MilSim Template). The template was created by Jan, Smargun and Spiderman from 'The Old Boys' | TOB.<br/>
Although we spend a year working on this, it would have been way longer if there wouldn't have been so many creators who explored things first, published their work and shared it with the community.<br/>
<br/>
Tons of Thanks go out to these legends:<br/>
- Kaylor K-Town Renslow for the unendlessly helpful Arma Dialog Creator that has helped with every GUI in this template.<br/>
- R3vo for his indispensably 3den Enhanced.<br/>
- NekyWaiWai (Supply Drop Script based on his tutorial).<br/>
- Xeno (Foggy Breath Script).<br/>
- The unknown guy who wrote made the Ground Fog Script.<br/>
- Indeed Pete (Ambience Vehicle Fire was based on his original).<br/>
- Enigx (Timer Function based on his script).<br/>
- The whole crowd at official Arma Discord that helped with every nag in this mess.<br/>
- The Legend that used this template to make another awesome Mission for the Arma Community and still left these Credits in!<br/>
